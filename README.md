Objective: Vrinda stores aims to creates an annual sales report for 2022 to better understand their customers and drive sales growth through in 2023.

During the creation of this dashboard, I acquired a diverse set of skills, including:

2. Using Excel formulas and functions to work with data
3. Making pivot tables
4. Designing the dashboard's look
5. Formatting slicers.

Key Insights:
1. Female customers displayed a higher purchase propensity compared to their male counterparts, with a percentage of approximately 65%.
2. The top-performing states were Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, with a combined contribution of approximately 35% to the overall sales.
3. Young adults within the age group of 21 to 35 were the most significant contributors, accounting for about 50% of the total sales.
4. Major sales contributions came from channels like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, with an impressive 80% impact.
5. Notably, the month of April saw the highest number of sales transactions.


Conclusion:-

For the store to improve its sales

The store must prioritize targeting female customers of the age group (30-49 years) residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by utilizing advertisements, coupons and discounts, offers, and other value-added services available on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart

The store must analyze the situations where they are encountering order cancellations, refunds, and order return requests from their customers.
